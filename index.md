My bragsheet: Well to start off I play the piano, I played the piano ever since I was about 4 years old but I seriously got into it every since I was 10. 

I am in robotics club, chess club and many other clubs

In 9th grade I was the environmental chair member for Youth Council board. 

In 11th grade I am planning on playing Football because I love the sport and planning on doing a lot of clubs.
